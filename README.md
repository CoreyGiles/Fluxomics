Mass isotopomer distribution analysis for stable isotope labelling in metabolomic and lipidomic studies.

In traditional mass spectrometry experiments, static measurements of biological metabolites are measured with no information regarding the synthesis or degradation rates. Coupling static and dynamic measurements will prove to be a powerful technique for understanding biological pertubations.

This software models mass isotopic enrichement of lipids by deuterium or (13)C. Based on fractional enrichment, the measured spectra is a sum of the natural isotope pattern for a compound and the enriched isotopic pattern for a given number of (2)H.
